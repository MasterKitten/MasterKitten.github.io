        <h3>Why might this site be educational?</h3>
        <p2>
            Well... I try to make the most educational experience that I can make. So far, since the site is bland, there isn't really that much here at the moment.
            <br>Later in the lifespan of this site, I want to put educational stuff so this site can't be banned.
            <br>I mean, we have a calculator and a flippy-do. Would that consider it "Cool math games" worthy?
